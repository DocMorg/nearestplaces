# nearestplaces
This code is supposed to find nearest places for the given one based on the set of all places, if each of these have an adress.<br />
I used <br />
• heapq algorithm while filling the array with data, so i won't need to sort the whole array once more; <br />
• yandex api to find each place's gps coordinates; <br />
• haversine formula to find the distance between coordinates of two places. <br />
