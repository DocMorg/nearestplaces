# nearestplaces
This code is supposed to find nearest places for the given one based on the set of all places, if each of these have an adress.
I used 
• heapq algorithm while filling the array with data, so i won't need to sort the whole array once more;
• yandex api to find each place's gps coordinates;
• haversine formula to find the distance between coordinates of two places.
